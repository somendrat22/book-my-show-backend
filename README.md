1. Create your dev branches for all the 3 apis.
2. Clone your project at 3 different locations. Why because we are having 3 apis. Name your folders accordingly example 1st -> db-api, 2nd -> exp-api
3. git clone projecturl
4. After cloning go to db-api folder and checkout your code to respective branch git checkout dev/db/studentname
5. exp-api -> git checkout branchname
6. mail-api -> git checkout branchname
7. Then work properly over your branches and when you feel my code is working fine or hw is done push your code.
8. After pushing your code raise pull request with master or main branch of your respective api.
